As the hall is for children's parties, the idea was to create a space suitable for different setups according to the event, while maintaining its own identity. A pastel color palette was chosen to decorate the ceiling, creating a sense of depth and emptiness. The white walls and floors create a clean space that gives a sense of openness and invites enjoyment of the celebration. The material palette includes: onyx, polished concrete with color, exposed structural steel, wood-like tiles, and synthetic grass. The result is a children's event hall that invites you to arrive, enjoy, and not want to leave."

The main challenge was to create an entirely new space without affecting the building’s overall structure. Based on the findings of a structural analysis, the decision was made to implement reinforcements that not only strengthened the structure but were also seamlessly integrated into the fixed furniture design. This approach aimed to create a more inviting atmosphere while maximizing the entry of natural light.The material palette includes acoustic glass, Calacatta marble/tazos, white quartz, and oak and walnut woodwork.The result is a warm, modern project that enhances the existing space, offering users a completely new experience in a 40-year-old apartment."

The design responds to the integration of a barbecue, living room, dining room, and space for a fireplace. We sought for this new space to contrast completely with the existing house (which is approximately 25 years old) but at the same time, to warmly integrate the barbecue - terrace - pool area. The material palette includes: Travertine marble, Antique Brown granite, exposed steel plates, IPR 10” x 10” profiles, glass roofing, and Oyamel wood lattice. This project presented an eco-technology challenge, as one of the key tasks was designing a rainwater collection system that would be 100% discreet visually and volumetrically. To achieve this, the size of the IPR profiles was used to contain 'channels' within them to direct the water to a 10,000-liter tank buried under the garden (this water is used during the rainy season for the house’s operations). The result is an extension to the house that contrasts, integrates, and invites you to spend the whole day in this part of the house."

The construction regulation limitations for this project include the type of roof that can be used for the new room on the rooftop. Therefore, a lightweight panel with acoustic and thermal qualities was used, in addition to optimizing the existing space delimited by an already-existing metal structure to cover the barbecue area. The material palette includes: structural steel, acoustic/thermal panel, wood-look ceramic, polycarbonate, carpentry details in Oyamel wood, and San Gabriel matte granite covers. The result of this design process, with various limitations, was a project that seamlessly integrates two areas with different architectural languages into one cohesive space."
